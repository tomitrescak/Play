overviewTemplate = "## Game Overview\n\n### Philosophy\n\n#### Philosophical point #1\n\nThis game is trying to do this and that.  Fundamentally I am trying to achieve something that has never been achieved before.  Or.  This game will not try and change the world.  We are ripping off the competition so exactly that I can\u2019t believe it.  The world will be shocked at how we are using an existing engine with new art.\n\n#### Philosophical point #2\n\nOur game only runs on Compaq computers.  The reason for this is such and such.  We believe the world is coming to and end anyhow so what difference does it make?\n\n#### Philosophical point #3\n\nWhen you create some of these overarching philosophical points about your design, say whatever you want.  Also, feel free to change it to \u201CMy game design goals\u201D or whatever you like to call it.\n\n## Common Questions\n\n### What is the game?\n\nDescribe the game is a paragraph.  This is the answer to the most common question that you will be asked.  What are you working on?\n\n### Why create this game?\n\nWhy are you creating this game?  Do you love 3D shooters?  Do you think there is a hole in the market for Jell-O tossing midgets?\n\n### Where does the game take place?\n\nDescribe the world that your game takes place in.  Simple as that.  Help frame it in the reader\u2019s mind by spending a few sentences on it here.  You can go into lengthy detail later in a section solely dedicated to describing the world.  Remember that we want to keep this part of the design light and readable.\n\n### What do I control?\n\nDescribe what the player will control.  You will be in charge of a band of rabid mutant fiddle players.  If you want you can switch on the AI and turn it into a fish bowl simulation.\n\n### How many characters do I control?\n\nIf this applies talk a little more about the control choices.  Remember to add answers to questions that you think the reader will ask.  This is totally dependent on your design.\n\n### What is the main focus?\n\nNow that we know where the game takes place and what the player controls.  What are they supposed to achieve in this world?  Angry fiddle players take over the U.N. building.  Be careful not to add a bunch of salesmanship here.  Your design wants to stay light and informative.\n\n### What\u2019s different?\n\nTell them what is different from the games that are attempting this in the market right now.  This question comes up a lot.\n";
